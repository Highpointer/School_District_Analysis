# School District Analysis
Below is a screenshot of the output of the Deliverable 1 requirements. For this analysis, the 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. The screenshot shows the code used to perform this analysis with explanatory comments to earn full credit of 50 points.

# Deliverable 3 Instructions
This part of the challenge presents a report that summarizes the updated analysis and compares it with the results from the module.

The purpose of this analysis was to replace all 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High Schools with NaNs and to repeat the analysis where the 9th grade testing data was not included in the calculations.

Before the 9th grades scores for Thomas High School were removed from the data analysis, average math and reading scores for the school, rounded to two decimal places, were 83.42 and 83.85, respectively. After removing the 9th grade scores, the averages became 83.35 and 83.90, respectively. This would appear that the changes in score averages were not significant after removing the 9th grade data. An actual statistical analysis (beyond the scope of this module) would likely confirm this to be true. 

Since the changes to the overall results for Thomas High School were apparently not significant, it did not affect the school's performance relative to other schools.

Removing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School from the entire district analysis did not significantly change the overall results. This includes the district summary and the school summary. Also, it did not affect math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
